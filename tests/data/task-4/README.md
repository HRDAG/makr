# Task 4

Reads input files from relative paths (`../task-2/output/cast.csv`, `../task-3/output/counts.json`) recalculates weights column, writes output (`output/report.md`). Dependency on task-2 and task-3. Note that this task also demonstrates a rudimentary reproducible research approach by inserting computed values directly into a markdown template.
